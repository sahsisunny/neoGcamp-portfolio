          <ul>
               <li>git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of changes in your code and collaborate
                    with
                    other developers.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="1-2-initialize-a-git-repository">1.2 Initialize a git repository</h2>
          <ul>
               <li>git init - we initialize a git repository in the current folder (the folder where we are located) and
                    we can
                    see that a new folder called .git has been created. This folder contains all the information about
                    the
                    repository. We can see that the folder is hidden because it starts with a dot. If we want to see the
                    hidden
                    files we can use the command ls -a. We can also use the command git status to see the status of the
                    repository.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="1-3-create-the-file-in-the-repository">1.3 Create the file in the repository</h2>
          <ul>
               <li>We create a file called index.html and we add some content to it. We can see that the file is not
                    being tracked
                    by git. We can see this by using the command git status. We can add the file to the repository using
                    the
                    command git add index.html. We can see that the file is now being tracked by git. We can see this by
                    using the
                    command git status. We can also use the command git add . to add all the files in the current folder
                    to the
                    repository.</li>

                    the file is
                    now being tracked by git. We can see this by using the command git status. We can also use the
                    command git add
                    . to add all the files in the current folder to the repository.</li>

               <li><strong>fix</strong> - A bug fix</li>
               <li><strong>docs</strong> - Documentation only changes</li>
               <li><strong>style</strong> - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting,
                    missing
                    semi-colons, etc)</li>
               <li><strong>refactor</strong> - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature</li>

          <ul>
               <li>When we type a URL in the browser, the browser sends a request to the DNS server to get the IP
                    address of the
                    server. The DNS server sends the IP address to the browser. The browser sends a request to the
                    server using
                    the IP address. The server sends a response to the browser. The browser renders the response.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="2-2-setup-netlify-to-deploy-the-website">2.2 Setup netlify to deploy the website</h2>
          <ul>
               <li>Netlify is a service that allows us to deploy our website. it is a hosting platform. We can deploy
