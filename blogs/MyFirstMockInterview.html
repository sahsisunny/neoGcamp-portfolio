               <h1>My 1️⃣ Mock Interview</h1>
          </div>
          <p>I recently had my first mock interview with a moderator from a neoGcamp community. Due to lack of fluently
               speaking in
               English I am not able to express my thoughts properly. I was
               not able to answer the questions.
          </p>
          <h2>Pattern of Mock Interview</h2>
          <p>My mock interview was on 25th November 2022. it was a 20 minutes interview. first 2 minutes was for intro
               and then 15
               minutes for coding part and the last 3 minutes was for conceptual questions. its pattern based on the
               neoGcamp
               interview.
          </p>
          <h2>Question Asked</h2>
          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <h4>1. Tell me about yourself?</h2>
               <p>
                    As you know that this is the first question asked in every interview. I was answering this question
                    but
                    in 3 lines less than 1 minute. I was not able to explain myself properly. my answer was like this
                    <i>Sure, so I am Sunny Sahsi basically from Patna, Bihar. i am currently pursuing my BCA degree from
                         Patna University.</i>
               </p>
               <h3>Coding Round</h3>
               <h4>2. Reverse the text entered by user when click the button and display. </h4>
               <p>

                    first of all, I want to tell you that I am practicing the 17-question given by neoGcamp interview
                    guide. there is no
                    question related to array and I was stuck and the time of 15 is over. For solving this question, I
                    was using the React
                    JS and I was using the useState hook for render the text and I was using array to reverse the text.
                    I was not able to
                    solve this question within 15 minutes. I was search on google two or three times. at the end I was
                    not able to solve
                    this question.
               </p>

               <h3>Conceptual Round</h3>
               <h4>3. What is useState and for loop?</h4>
               <p>Both are the basic question. I understand the useState hook and for loop but due to lack of fluently
                    speaking in English
                    I was not able to explain it properly. I think Moderator was understanding my answer.
               </p>

               <h3>Feedback from Moderator</h3>
               <p>
                    Moderator was very nice and he was giving me feedback after end of the interview. he was telling me
                    that
                    you are not able to speak properly and you are not able to explain your answer properly. he was
                    telling me that you are not able to solve the question within 15 minutes. he was telling me that
                    you are not able to explain the useState hook and for loop properly.
               </p>
               <h3>Conclusion</h3>
               <ul>
                    <li>I was not able to solve the question within 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>I was not able to explain my answer properly.</li>
                    <li>I was not able to explain the useState hook and for loop . </li>
