          <h2 id="1-what-is-dom-">1. What is DOM?</h2>
          <p>DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can
               change the
               document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way,
               programming
               languages can connect to the page.</p>
          <h2 id="2-what-is-an-api-">2. What is an API?</h2>
          <p>An API is a set of functions and procedures that allow the creation of applications that access the
               features or data
               of an operating system, application, or other service.</p>
          <h2 id="3-what-is-semantic-html-">3. What is Semantic HTML?</h2>
          <p>Semantic HTML means that the tags we use actually mean something. For example, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> means
               paragraph. <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> means main heading. These elements are not just for presentation, but
               they also
               represent the content of our pages.
               and <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> are not semantic elements because they
               don&#39;t
               represent anything. They are just used for styling.</p>
          <h2 id="4-what-is-the-difference-between-inline-and-inline-block-">4. What is the difference between inline
               and
               inline-block?</h2>
          <p>Inline elements are elements that do not start on a new line and do not take up the full width available.
               Inline-block elements are elements that do not start on a new line but do take up the full width
               available. we can
               set the width and height of inline-block elements.</p>
          <h2 id="5-explain-about-promises-">5. Explain about promises.</h2>
          <p>A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value, or
               a reason
               that itâ€™s not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states:
               fulfilled,
               rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for
               rejection.

               HTML
               file?</h2>
          <p>There are three ways to link a stylesheet to an HTML file:</p>
          <ul>
               <li>External CSS : <code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;mystyle.css&quot;&gt;</code></li>
               <li>Internal CSS : <code>&lt;style&gt; body {background-color: linen;} &lt;/style&gt;</code></li>
               <li>Inline CSS : <code>&lt;p style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</code></li>

          </h2>
          <p>If we place the script tag inside the head tag, the script will be executed before the page is loaded. This
               will
               cause the page to load slowly. and it will also cause the page to load incorrectly and some functions
               will not work
               properly.</p>

               among
               multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be

          <p>GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code.
               It offers
               all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding
               its own

          <p>Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time. By default your repository
               has one
               branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and
               make edits
               before committing them to master.</p>

          <p>A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside
               the outer
               function to complete some kind of routine or action. Curly braces are not added to it because it is a

          <p>I like the fact that React is a component-based library which makes it easy to reuse the code and also

               Variables.
               Demonstration with code was also asked.</h2>
          <p>CSS Variables are used to store the values of properties which are used repeatedly in the code. This helps
               in
               reducing the code size and also makes the code more readable. It also helps in making the code more
               dynamic and
               easy to change.
               An example of CSS Variables is as follows:</p>
          <pre><code class="lang-css">:root {
       -- main-<span class="hljs-attribute">color</span>: <span class="hljs-number">#f00</span>;
     }
     
     <span class="hljs-selector-tag">h1</span> {
       <span class="hljs-attribute">color</span>: var(--main-color);
     }

               fetch
               API.</h2>
          <p>Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are used to handle multiple
               asynchronous
               operations where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code. A promise has 3 states:
               pending,
               fulfilled, rejected. A promise is created using the new Promise constructor which takes a function as its
               argument
               with two parameters resolve and reject. The resolve function is called when the promise is fulfilled and
               the reject
               function is called when the promise is rejected. The then() function is used to handle the fulfilled
               promise and
               the catch() function is used to handle the rejected promise.</p>

               script tag
               at the bottom in the index.html file.</h2>
          <p>Placing the script tag at the bottom of the index.html file helps in loading the HTML file first and then
               the script
               file. This helps in reducing the loading time of the page.</p>

          </h2>
          <p>Yes, we can use any selector like id, class, tag name, etc.</p>
          <ul>
               <li>For id: document.querySelector(&quot;#id&quot;)</li>

          <h2 id="25-difference-between-class-and-id-">25. Difference between class and id.</h2>
          <p>The class selector is used to select all the elements with the same class name whereas the id selector is

          <p>The box model is used to represent the HTML elements as boxes. It consists of the content, padding, border,
               and
               margin. The content is the actual content of the element. The padding is the space between the content
               and the
               border. The border is the border of the element. The margin is the space between the border and the
               adjacent
               element.</p>

          <p>I like the following features of React:</p>
          <ul>
               <li>It is a component-based library which makes it easy to reuse the code and also makes the code more
                    readable.
               </li>
               <li>It is a declarative library which makes it easy to understand.</li>
               <li>It is a fast library means it is fast to load and also fast to render.</li>
               <li>It is a flexible library which makes it easy to integrate with other libraries.</li>
               <li>It is a scalable library which makes it easy to scale means it is easy to add new features to the
                    existing
                    code.</li>

          <p>Fetch is used to make HTTP requests in JavaScript. It is used to make asynchronous requests to the server.
               It returns
               a promise which is handled using the then() and catch() functions.</p>

          <ul>
               <li>JavaScript is asynchronous.</li>
               <li>It is a single-threaded language which means that it can only execute one task at a time.</li>
               <li>It uses an event loop to handle asynchronous operations.</li>

          <p>There are 4 ways of using fetch:</p>
          <ul>
               <li>GET request : fetch(url) is used to make a GET request.</li>
               <li>POST request : fetch(url, {method: &quot;POST&quot;}) is used to make a POST request.</li>
               <li>PUT request : fetch(url, {method: &quot;PUT&quot;}) is used to make a PUT request.</li>
               <li>DELETE request : fetch(url, {method: &quot;DELETE&quot;}) is used to make a DELETE request.</li>

          <p>The key is used to uniquely identify each element in the list. It is used by React to identify which items
